Exercise: Decomposition
Write out all the steps necessary for your mini-capstone backend to allow users to purchase products. (aim for roughly 5 to 10 steps)
For now, a user can submit an order for any quantity of a single product (we are not implementing a “shopping cart” where an order contains multiple products).
Do not write any code for this exercise; just focus on decomposing the different steps necessary to complete the feature.

1. User sends post request for their purchase, including parameters for quantity. Product_ID is implicitly included within the purchase based on which purchase button the user presses
2. Verify user has active session. If not, send to login page
3. Retrieve information from the product by product_id (price)
4. Multiply the price * quantity => subtotal
5. Calculate tax
6. Calculate total
7. Send request to purchase handler to take payment info / shipping info
