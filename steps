Working towards:
1. Change your mini-capstone so there can be multiple images, instead of just one. (This will take multiple steps - try decomposing the process before you start it!)
You will need to remove the image_url attribute from the Product model and create an entirely new Image model to do this.
Use url as the image attribute to get this to work seamlessly with the mini-capstone front end.
2. Change your json to show all images with each product.
You can test your code using the frontend at https://mini-capstone.peterxjang.com/model-associations/products. If your associations are working correctly, it will show multiple images on the products show page in a carousel!
